[//]: # (title: Image to Code OCR)

One of the core features of our Flagship Desktop App is the ability to extract usable code from screenshots and other images with our code-specific OCR engine.

Whether you capture code from an online article or tutorial or often receive screenshots of code from your teammates, Pieces for Developers will transform that material into easily editable code both in our [Flagship Desktop App](https://code.pieces.app/install) and in our **Pieces for Developers | JetBrains Plugin**.
