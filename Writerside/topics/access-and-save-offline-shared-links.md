[//]: # (title: Access and Save Offline Shared Links)

![](SAVE_FROM_WEB.gif)

Although it's not needed to have [Pieces for Developers](https://code.pieces.app/install) installed when accessing a shared resource, we don't want our users having to switch back and forth to the browser or needing to keep track of all the share links you've received.

- Simply click the **_Save to Pieces_** button located at the top of the [Sharing Preview Web App](personalized-link-sharing-of-saved-materials-and-their-context-metadata.md), and you're good to go! You can now access and reuse the locally saved resource in our Flagship Desktop App or directly in your IDE with the JetBrains Plugin.

> Recipients that have Pieces for Developers desktop app can easily save a copy of the shared resource to their own Pieces for Developers drive for offline search, suggestion, and reuse later on.
