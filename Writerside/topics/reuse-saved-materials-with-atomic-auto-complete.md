[//]: # (title: Reuse Saved Materials with Atomic Auto Complete)

![](NEW_FILE_AUTO_COMPLETE.gif)

From the Language Servers that ship with JetBrains, to the recent variety of LLM offerings like GitHub Co-Pilot and TabNine, there are already plenty of great options for auto-completing code.
With this in mind and leveraging our on-device Pattern Engine, we wanted to take a complimentary approach to these existing systems.

- Our goal isn't to auto-complete from all possibilities, in all scenarios; but more specifically, auto-complete from your saved code snippets, in scenarios where it makes the most sense.
> **i.e. Creating a new file from saved boilerplate, writing unit tests, or integrating marketing scripts such as Google Analytics or Facebook Pixel Tags.**
